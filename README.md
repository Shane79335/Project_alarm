Observations

  •	I frequently need to get on to assignments and studying for classes
  
  •	While attempting to perform my goal I frequently get distracted and stop to do something else.

Problem
______________________
As a student it is my goal to learn and complete my assignments given to me. However, distractions often come about, and I stop performing my assignment. Then I shall forget about it or say I will do it later until reminded.

Solution
_________________________
Building an android app that periodically reminds the user of any assignments that they are working on. This app will have a timer adjustable by the user for the intervals between notifications. It must be manually turn off and adjusted.
